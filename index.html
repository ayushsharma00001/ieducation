            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The main field investigating education is called education studies. It
                examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has,
                and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education,
                sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history
                of education. In pre-history, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation.
                With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented and the amount of knowledge grew.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is.

                Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education,
                primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as
                improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion
                rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability,
                promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by
                various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy
                2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the
                Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by
                various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations,
                academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.
